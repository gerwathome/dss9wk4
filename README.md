### Fitting a Linear Model with a Shiny Application

This project is to fulfill the week four requirements of the Coursera course *Developing Data Products*.  This project includes developing a Shiny application and a slide presentation describing the application.  I have chosen to use RStudio Presenter to develop the slide presentation, and to publish the slides on RPubs.  The Shiny application is published on RStudio's Shiny server.

This project has two directories:

- **linearModel** contains the Shiny app
- **linearModelSlides** contains the slides and the R code used to develop them

The Shiny app is published at:   [linearModel](https://georgewilliams.shinyapps.io/linearModel/) 


The slides are published at:  [linearModelSlides](http://rpubs.com/george_williams/274754)
